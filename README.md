# Storage Space

Storage Space helps users monitor storage space by scanning the contents of a selected folder and displaying the size of each folder and file within it. Users can see how much space is occupied by individual files or folders, which is useful for managing storage. The app also visualizes the percentage of space used on each mounted volume (e.g., hard drives, external drives) to help with volume management.

Includes a desktop widget that shows at a glance storage space information in three sizes:
- Small (Shows system volume)
- Medium (System volume + first 3 mounted volumes in alphabetical order)
- Large (System volume + first 7 mounted volumes in alphabetical order)

ï»¿Requires macOS 14.1 or later
